<!-- DESCRIPTION/ -->

A highly experimental alternative module installer

<!-- /DESCRIPTION -->


## Installation

Download and compile the [Symlinks Just Work](https://github.com/rstacruz/pnpm/issues/496#issuecomment-266301933) branch of node, if you haven't already.

```sh
git clone --branch v7.2.0-sjw https://github.com/zkochan/node
```

You can install this module normally using `npm`.

```sh
npm install --global modinst
```

## Usage

For now, I will just provide an example:

TODO: embed asciinema demo


## Tests

Tests presuppose that you know what to expect. I really don't know what to expect. Things could change dramatically.
